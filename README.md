# OnlinEngagement

# Title:


In recent years, with the popularization of online education, real-time monitoring
of learning engagement has become a key challenge for scholars. Existing studies 
mainly rely on questionnaires and physiological signal detection, which have
limitations such as high subjectivity, poor real-time performance, and expensive
equipment. Although it has been confirmed that head pose is closely related to
cognitive state, the current head pose estimation model has high computational
resource requirements and is challenging to apply in real-time on mobile devices.
In this study, we validate the significant correlation between head pose and learning 
engagement based on the DAiSEE dataset(8925 video clips) and propose a
lightweight head pose estimation method. The LightNet proposed in this paper
uses an improved feature extraction module (MG-Net) and an attention fusion
module (AMF). Experiments on the 300W-LP and BIWI benchmark datasets
show that compared to existing methods, LightNet reduces the number of parameters 
to 0.45Ã—106, which is more than a 90% reduction while maintaining higher
accuracy. This study not only expands the application of head pose in education 
but also provides a feasible solution for real-time participation monitoring
on resource-constrained devices.
