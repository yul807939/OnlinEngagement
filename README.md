# LightNet: Enhancing Engagement Assessment in Online Education via Lightweight Head Pose Estimation


In recent years, the popularity of online education has necessitated real-time monitoring of learning engagement. Traditional methods, such as questionnaires and physiological signal detection, are limited by subjectivity, poor real-time performance, and high equipment costs. Although head pose has been shown to correlate with cognitive state, current head pose estimation models demand high computational resources, hindering their application on mobile devices. This study validates the significant correlation between head pose and learning engagement using the DAiSEE dataset (8925 video clips) and proposes LightNet, a lightweight head pose estimation method. LightNet employs an improved feature extraction module (MG-Net) and an attention fusion module (AMF). Experiments on the 300W-LP and BIWI benchmark datasets reveal that LightNet reduces parameters to 0.45×10^6, a reduction of over 90%, while maintaining high accuracy (MAE=4.09°). Here we show that LightNet not only expands the application of head pose in education but also provides a feasible solution for real-time engagement monitoring on resource-constrained devices.
